# notAcceptOPCommand

What would you do if someone planted a backdoor plugin in your computer?
This plugin will detect and disable the OP itself.
Please make sure to use the permission management plugin.
Administrators do not have to be OPs.
If you take the appropriate steps, you will be protected from attacks.
This is a plugin that supports that. Thank you.
